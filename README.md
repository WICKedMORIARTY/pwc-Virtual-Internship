# pwc-PowerBI-Virtual-Internship
Tasks related to visualizations using PowerBI

Fiddling around in Excel sheets just doesn’t suit a digital jedi. In Switzerland, PwC’s Digital Upskilling Academy helps the people move from zero to digital hero. PwC is upskilling 284,000 people because the right digital skills make us agile, adaptable and fit for the future.

Learning to master Power BI is a good first step. I have used powerful Data Analytics tools to help solve business problems for our hypothetical clients in this Virtual Internship.  By empowering myself to identify patterns, risks and opportunities in data, I have worked more effeciently than usual. I was able to clearly visualise the value of data and turn it into convincing, actionable insights for this Forage's pwc Virtual Program.
